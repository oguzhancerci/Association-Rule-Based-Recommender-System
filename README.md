# Business Problem:
Our client wants to increase their sales by providing personalized product recommendations to their customers. They want to implement a recommender system that utilizes association rules to suggest items to users based on their past behavior.

# Process:

1- Understanding the business problem and data
2- Preprocessing the data (removing duplicates, handling missing values, transforming the data)
3- Applying the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets
4- Generating association rules from the frequent itemsets
5- Implementing the recommender system and testing its performance
6- Evaluating the results and recommending business decisions

# Dataset:
The dataset consists of transactional data that includes information about the products purchased by customers. Each row represents a transaction, and the columns correspond to the items purchased. The dataset will be preprocessed to remove duplicates and handle missing values.

# Apriori Algorithm:
The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used for mining frequent itemsets in a dataset. It works by first identifying all frequent items (items that appear in a minimum number of transactions), and then using these frequent items to generate candidate itemsets of length two. It continues this process, using the candidate itemsets to generate larger itemsets until no more frequent itemsets can be found. The algorithm is efficient and scalable, making it ideal for large transactional datasets.

# Recommender System:
The recommender system will be implemented using the association rules generated from the Apriori algorithm. When a user requests recommendations, the system will look for items that are associated with the items the user has already purchased. It will then suggest the most likely items based on the association rules it has generated.
